📚 Plagiarism Detector using Machine Learning (Flask App)
This project is a machine learning-powered web app that detects potential plagiarism in user-submitted text. Built using Python, Flask, and scikit-learn, it combines NLP preprocessing with a trained ML model to evaluate the similarity or originality of text input.

🚀 Features
1. Machine Learning Model trained on real-world data
2. Text vectorization using TF-IDF
3. Web Interface with Flask and HTML
4. Outputs a plagiarism score
5. Easy to run locally

📦 Tech Stack
1. Python 3
2. Flask
3. Scikit-learn (SVC)
4. HTML/CSS (Jinja2 templating)
5. Jupyter Notebook (for training logic)

🔍 How It Works
1. User submits a block of text through the web form.
2. The text is vectorized using a pre-trained TF-IDF vectorizer.
3. The ML model predicts the likelihood of plagiarism.
4. Result is displayed instantly in the browser.
